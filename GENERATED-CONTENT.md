## 1. PECAN RESEARCH DESCRIPTION (200 words)

PECAN (Programming Encoder Classification Analysis Network) represents my commitment to developing AI systems that balance performance with accessibility. Working with Dr. James Ghawaly in the AISX Lab alongside research collaborator Jackson Descant, I am fine-tuning small encoder-only models to identify programming languages with greater accuracy than current state-of-the-art tools.

The challenge in programming language identification lies not just in achieving high accuracy, but in doing so with models that are lightweight and deployable. Existing tools like GuessLang and GitHub Linguist achieve approximately 90% accuracy, but struggle with modern, diverse codebases. PECAN addresses this gap by leveraging transformer-based architectures, specifically fine-tuning models like CodeBERT on a dataset of over 10 million code samples across 54+ programming languages, with plans for continued expansion.

Our approach has achieved 99.7% accuracy, demonstrating that smaller, well-designed models can deliver state-of-the-art performance. This work reinforces my conviction that AI systems should strike a balance between accessibility and performance. We are currently preparing a submission to an A* conference, contributing to the broader understanding of how efficient model design can advance software engineering tools.

PECAN embodies my belief that AI should empower rather than replace human expertise, providing developers with more accurate tools while maintaining computational efficiency.

Leadership, to me, means creating environments where technology serves people and where collaboration amplifies individual strengths. This philosophy has been shaped by my experiences across research, industry, and service—each teaching me that effective communication is the bridge between technical excellence and meaningful impact.

From a young age, I've been captivated by the question posed in I, Robot: can AI enhance human creativity, or does it diminish it? This fundamental tension—between human reasoning and machine intelligence—has shaped not just my research interests, but my approach to leadership. I believe leaders in technology must navigate this balance thoughtfully, ensuring that our tools empower rather than replace human creativity and reasoning.

In practice, this philosophy manifests as servant leadership. Whether guiding student teams as a Teaching Assistant, leading development efforts for climate technology, or supporting clean water initiatives through Water Brigades, I've learned that the most impactful leadership comes from enabling others. As Scrum Master for the Nexus Louisiana ClimateTech Challenge, I don't just manage sprints—I facilitate collaboration, remove blockers, and ensure every team member's voice contributes to our shared vision of addressing Louisiana's CO₂ emissions.

Communication is central to this leadership approach. In my TA role for AI and LLM Development, I've discovered that translating complex technical concepts into accessible guidance is as important as the technical work itself. When helping students navigate challenges with industry partners like Entergy and BASF, I've learned to adapt my communication style—explaining advanced practices in ways that make them achievable rather than intimidating.

My education in Computer Science and Mathematics has taught me to think systematically and solve problems rigorously. But my experiences in leadership have taught me something equally valuable: technical solutions only create impact when combined with clear communication, ethical consideration, and genuine commitment to serving communities.

Whether I'm presenting MikeGPT research at Discover Day, collaborating with teammates at Tri-Core Technologies, or maintaining the Water Brigades website, I strive to embody leadership that balances technical excellence with human-centered purpose. This approach—using communication to bridge technical expertise and real-world impact—defines how I lead and how I hope to contribute to advancing AI that serves humanity.

My role involves guiding student teams as they develop AI-driven solutions for complex problems presented by industry partners like Entergy and BASF.

My mentoring philosophy centers on making advanced technical concepts accessible rather than intimidating. When students struggle with implementing retrieval-augmented generation or fine-tuning models, I don't just provide answers—I ask questions that guide them toward understanding. I've learned to recognize different learning styles: some students need visual diagrams, others prefer walking through code line-by-line, while some learn best through debugging real problems together.

One particularly rewarding moment came when a student team was struggling with their vector database implementation. Rather than fixing it myself, I facilitated a discussion where they identified the issue through systematic troubleshooting. Watching their confidence grow as they debugged the solution themselves was more valuable than any quick fix I could have provided.

Teaching has taught me patience, adaptability, and the art of explaining complexity simply. More importantly, it has reinforced my belief that education is about empowering others to solve problems independently—a philosophy that aligns perfectly with my vision of AI as a tool for augmentation rather than replacement.

My philosophy on technology ethics is rooted in a fundamental question from I, Robot: Should AI enhance or replace human creativity? I believe this question extends beyond creativity to encompass human reasoning, judgment, and autonomy. Ethical AI development requires ensuring our systems augment rather than diminish what makes us human.

**Privacy and Data Stewardship**

Working on MikeGPT at LSU taught me that handling user data is a profound responsibility. When building an AI assistant serving thousands of students and faculty, every architectural decision carries ethical weight. We implemented strict data handling protocols, ensuring that student queries remain private and that our retrieval system accesses only public university documents. This wasn't just about regulatory compliance—it was about honoring the trust our community placed in us. I learned that privacy isn't a feature to add later; it must be foundational to system architecture.

**Bias, Fairness, and Representation**

In developing PECAN, training on 10+ million code samples across 54 languages, I've grappled with questions of representation and bias. Which programming languages receive priority? How do we ensure our model performs equitably across different coding styles and conventions? These aren't just technical challenges—they're ethical ones. We've worked deliberately to ensure diverse language representation, recognizing that algorithmic fairness requires intentional design choices, not just technical optimization.

**Accountability and Transparency**

Leading the ClimateTech Challenge reinforced the importance of accountability in AI systems. When building tools to track CO₂ emissions for Louisiana's $23 billion CCUS initiative, transparency isn't optional—it's essential for public trust and environmental accountability. This project taught me that AI systems addressing societal challenges must be explainable, auditable, and subject to meaningful oversight.

**AI for Social Good**

My commitment to using technology for public benefit—from MikeGPT's educational support to Water Brigades' humanitarian outreach—stems from believing that technical expertise carries social responsibility. AI should address genuine human needs, not just demonstrate technical prowess. This means asking difficult questions: Who benefits from this technology? Who might be harmed?
