# Deployment Guide for GitHub Pages

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Repository Setup
Your repository is already set up correctly as `ialam04.github.io`. This is the correct naming convention for GitHub Pages user sites.

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
5. Click "Save"

### 3. Automatic Deployment
- Every push to the main branch will trigger automatic deployment
- Changes typically go live within 1-2 minutes
- No build process required (static site)

### 4. Custom Domain (Optional)
If you want to use a custom domain:
1. Purchase a domain from a registrar
2. Create a `CNAME` file in the root directory with your domain name
3. Configure your domain's DNS settings to point to GitHub Pages
4. Update the repository settings with your custom domain
