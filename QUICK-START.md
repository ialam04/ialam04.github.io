## Step 1: Record Your Intro Video (10 minutes) 🎥

**Right now, on your phone:**

1. Find a quiet spot with good lighting
2. Open your camera app
3. Record yourself saying (60 seconds):

> "Hi, I'm Ibrahim Alam, a Computer Science student at Louisiana State University and an LSU Stamps Scholar. 
> 
> I'm passionate about using artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. Currently, I'm conducting research at the AISX Lab, where I'm developing PECAN - a system that achieves 99.5% accuracy in identifying programming languages. 
>
> Beyond research, I've deployed AI systems that serve over 30,000 people at LSU, demonstrating my commitment to making technology accessible and impactful.
>
> I believe in servant leadership and using my technical skills to create positive change, whether through my research, my work on AI systems like MikeGPT, or my service with organizations like LSU Water Brigades.
>
> I'm excited to share my work with you through this portfolio."

4. Upload to YouTube as "Unlisted" or save to share with me
5. **DONE!** ✅

## Step 2: Write PECAN Abstract (15 minutes) ✍️

**Open a doc and write 200-300 words:**

**Paragraph 1 - The Problem:**
"Programming language identification is critical for [why it matters]. Existing tools like GuessLang and GitHub Linguist achieve only 90% accuracy..."

**Paragraph 2 - Your Solution:**
"PECAN (Programming Encoder Classification Analysis Network) uses transformer-based models... trained on 10M+ code samples... achieving 99.5% accuracy across 100+ languages..."

**Paragraph 3 - Impact:**
"This research has implications for [IDE integration, code analysis, software engineering tools]... Currently preparing paper for submission to top-tier ML conference..."

**Copy the template from CONTENT-TEMPLATES.md for structure!**

## Step 3: Quick Screenshot Gathering (5 minutes) 📸

**Grab these if you have them ready:**

1. Open MikeGPT in browser → Take screenshot
2. Find any PECAN graphs you have → Save images
3. Open any project → Take 2-3 screenshots
4. Save all to `/assets/portfolio/` folder
