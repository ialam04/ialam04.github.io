# Updates Complete - October 30, 2025

## ✅ Three Fixes Implemented

### 1. Corrected MikeGPT Collaborators & Presenters

**Discover Day Citation Updated:**
- **Co-presenters:** Jacob Nguyen, Bibushita Baral (presenting with you at Discover Day)
- **Citation now reads:** Alam I, Nguyen J, Baral B. "MikeGPT: Enhancing LSU with AI"

**Credits Section Updated:**
- **MikeGPT Team:** Jacob Nguyen, Bibushita Baral (Co-collaborators & Discover Day Co-presenters); Dr. James Ghawaly, Brandon Walton, Chloe Gray (Co-collaborators)
- Clear distinction between those who presented and those who collaborated

### 2. Updated TA Reflection with Specific Example

**New Content:**
- Changed from generic "vector database implementation" to specific **"building evaluation pipelines for RAG systems and models"**
- Added that you're **preparing to lecture on evaluation pipeline design**
- More specific and impactful example showing your expertise

**Updated paragraph:**
> "One particularly rewarding moment came when a student team was struggling with building evaluation pipelines for their RAG systems and models. Rather than fixing it myself, I facilitated a discussion where they identified the issues through systematic troubleshooting. Watching their confidence grow as they debugged the solution themselves was more valuable than any quick fix I could have provided. This experience was so impactful that I'm now preparing to lecture on evaluation pipeline design, sharing these practical insights with the entire class."

### 3. Improved Written Communication Structure

**Created Dedicated Pages:**
- ✅ **pecan.html** - Already existed, kept as is
- ✅ **mikegpt.html** - NEW dedicated page for MikeGPT technical documentation

**Updated Portfolio Cards:**
- **PECAN Card:** Condensed to 2 paragraphs with key highlights (99.5% accuracy, 54+ languages)
- **MikeGPT Card:** Condensed to 3 paragraphs with key metrics (95% accuracy, 30,000+ users, 38,000+ docs)
- Both cards now have clear "Read Full [Details/Documentation] →" links

**Benefits:**
1. ✅ Main portfolio page is cleaner and more scannable
2. ✅ Detailed technical content lives on dedicated pages
3. ✅ Better user experience - readers can choose depth level
4. ✅ Professional structure similar to research portfolios
5. ✅ Easy to link from CV, LinkedIn, or other materials
